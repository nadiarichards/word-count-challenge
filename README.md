# Full Stack Word Count App

Please use this link to interact with the project.

## Background
---
This project's main purpose was to make a full stack app that utilizes multiple tools including Python (multiple libraries, Flask API) and front-end work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Premise: The word count app can be a writer's best friend. One can quickly upload their file to get a number of useful metrics. The metrics to choose from are as follows:
* Classic Word Count
* Unique Word Count (currently set to show words repeated over 5 times to minimize the output)
* Classic Character Count
* Unique Character Count (count per each letter of the alphabet in the alpabetical order)
* Sentence Count
* Paragraph Count
* Bigram Count (currently set to show bigrams repeated over 2 time sto minimize the output)
* Word Ocurrence Cunt (takes text file and word to count occcurrences for as an input)


## Tools and Technology Used for the Project
---
* Visual Studio Code
* txt files
* Python
* Regex
* Tokenizer (nltk library)
* Javascript
* CSS
* HTML
* Flask App


## Process Flow
---
1. Create each function and test it on the sample txt file
2. Create Flask API
3. Pull data into browser using JavaScript
4. Generate front end using JavaScript
7. HTML and CSS formatting / organization
